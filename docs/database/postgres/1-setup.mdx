## Installing the PostgreSQL

To install PostgreSQL using homebrew, run the following command:

:::info

Make sure you have homebrew installed and updated. if not run the following command to update:

```bash
brew update
```

:::

```bash
brew install postgresql
```

### Installing the libpq client library <sup>[1](#references)</sup>

:::caution

You do not need to install `libpq` if you already have PostgreSQL installed using above command. Ony install libpq if you do not have postgresql installed and want to use psql and pg_dump clients.

:::

To install **libpq** using homebrew, use the following command:

```bash
brew install libpq
```

This will give you access to utilities such as **psql** and **pg_dump** without having to install the full Postgres package.

However, since homebrew provides some of the same utilities as Postgres, it is installed as `"keg-only"` by default. This means that it is not in the `PATH` by default. Homebrew will provide instructions on how to add it to the PATH after installation.

In my case, it was this:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/libpq/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Alternatively, you can create symlinks for the utilities you need, for example:

```bash
ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/libpq/14.3/bin/psql /usr/local/bin/psql
```

:::note

replace 14.3 with the version of libpq that is installed.

:::

Alternatively, you could instruct homebrew to "link all of its binaries to the PATH anyway"

```bash
brew link --force libpq
```

but then **you would not be able to install the Postgres package later**.

## Managing the PostgreSQL

As we have installed postgresql with homebrew, we will use homebrew to start and stop the service.

### Start the postgres service

```bash
brew services start postgresql
```

### Stop the postgres service

```bash
brew services stop postgresql
```

Once it is up and running, you can create a new user to log in and interact with the database.

```bash
psql postgres
```

After you have logged in, you can create a new user and database:

```sql
CREATE USER <username> WITH PASSWORD '<password>';
```

Add `CREATE DATABASE` permission to the user

```sql
ALTER ROLE <username> WITH CREATEDB;
```
