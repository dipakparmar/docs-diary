## Resetting a Forgotten Ubuntu Password via GRUB

If you've forgotten your Ubuntu server password, you can reset it using the GRUB boot menu. You can reset via one of these two methods: using recovery mode or editing the GRUB boot parameters.

## Method 1: Using Recovery Mode

This method is recommended for most users as it is more straightforward.

1. **Reboot the server.**
2. While the server is starting, press and hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> (or <kbd>Esc</kbd> for UEFI systems) to display the GRUB menu.
3. In the GRUB menu, select **Advanced options for Ubuntu** and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
4. Choose the entry that includes <code>(recovery mode)</code> and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to boot into the recovery menu.
5. Select **root: Drop to root shell prompt** and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
6. By default, the file system is mounted as read-only. Remount it with read-write permissions:
   ```bash
   mount -rw -o remount /
   ```
7. To find your username (if you don't know it), list the home directories:
   ```bash
   ls /home
   ```
8. Reset the user's password:
   ```bash
   passwd <username>
   ```
   Replace `<username>` with your actual username. Follow the prompts to set the new password.
9. Type `exit` to return to the recovery menu.
10. Select **resume: Resume normal boot** to restart your server.

:::info
After reboot, you can log in with the new password.

## Method 2: Editing GRUB Boot Parameters

This method boots directly into a root shell, skipping the recovery menu.

1. Reboot and hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> or <kbd>Esc</kbd> to enter the GRUB menu.
2. Select the standard Ubuntu boot entry and press <kbd>e</kbd> to edit.
3. Find the line starting with <code>linux /boot/vmlinuz-...</code>.
4. Remove the parameters `ro quiet splash` and append:
   ```bash
   rw init=/bin/bash
   ```
5. Press <kbd>F10</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl+X</kbd> to boot.
6. The system will boot to a passwordless root shell. Set the password:
   ```bash
   passwd <username>
   ```
7. After resetting the password, reboot the system:
   ```bash
   exec /sbin/init
   ```

:::caution
Use these methods only on systems you are authorized to access.
